## Lab01- Java primitives and control flow

### Overview

This lab is dedicated to practicing Java fundamentals. These problems will challenge your understanding of Java’s built-in primitive values (ints, floats, doubles, Strings, booleans), for loops, while loops, if statements, functions, parameters and return statements.

### Feature Tasks

1. **Pluralize**               
A function called pluralize that accepts a word and a number and returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one.

2. **Flipping Coins**           
A function called flipNHeads that accepts an integer n and flips coins until n heads are flipped in a row.

3. **Command Line Clock**             
 A method clock that uses Java’s built-in LocalDateTime object to constantly print out the current time to the console, second by second.

## Lab02- Arrays, Loops, Imports, ArrayLists

### Overview

This lab is dedicated to creating, interacting with and manipulating arrays in Java. Arrays in Java have a fixed size. Arrays are created with a certain size and they never shrink or grow. Java arrays are typed.


### Feature Tasks

1. **Rolling Dice**                      
A method called roll that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. The method should return an array containing the values of the rolls.

2. **Contains Duplicates**

A method called containsDuplicates that returns true or false depending on whether the array contains duplicate values.

3. **Calculating Averages**          
A method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

4. **Arrays of Arrays**
Taking an array of arrays calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.

5. **Testing**
